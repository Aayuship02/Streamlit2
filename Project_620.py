st.markdown(' climate change will continue to occur throughout years to come.  Human activity will continue to affect climate change daily and cause temperature anomalies yearly.  The good news is that as temperatures rise we can be sure that production of crops will continue to rise gradually.  As seen in the charts above there was mainly always an increase in production even if at times it decreased for a few years.  Although climate change can affect us in many ways like strong heat waves where it can be devastating to work out in the sun, crops are essential to our lives.  As we were able to see the production of crops in Africa rise, I can assume the same for other continents in the world.  Not only rice, wheat and potatoes but other crops as well.  ')
